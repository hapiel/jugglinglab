# Introduction

Siteswap simulators and siteswap pattern generators are very useful tools to jugglers. Countless tricks have been discovered with the help of generators, and tricks have been learnt with the help of simulators or animators.

Once you understand a bit of siteswap it is a lot of fun to plug in various sequences of numbers into a simulator and test all kinds of patterns to see what they would look like. But, there are a lot of features of juggling that can't be described with siteswaps, and almost all juggling simulators that I'm aware of are siteswap based.

[Rhythmic Catches](../rhythmic_catches/) and [IMBO](../improved_body_trick_notation/) have been designed with trick generation and simulation mind. Together with Ilse Arwert I attempted to modify Juggling Lab to make it suitable for these notation systems.

# Why? (DANIEL)

What are the possible motivations to generate or simulate tricks?

## Generation

Trick generation allows you to explore trick discovery in a different way than by testing out ideas with props in a studio. It can be faster and easier, and with a good tool you can filter for exactly the kind of trick you are looking for. For example you might look for tricks that take a certain amount of beats, involve a certain amount of jugglers, include certain kinds of throws or exclude throws above a certain height. Also one can look for variations on a particular trick. With a more detailed notation system, more parameters become available to discover or to filter for.

There is also a more philosophical aspect to trick generation. If a trick is generated by a computer, rather than organically found by a juggler, who is then the inventor of that trick? Can one still claim ownership of an idea if that idea is the natural result of a model of juggling that is able to generate that idea? I hope that with better generators we can further this debate.

## Simulation

Once you have a notation for a trick, you can try and visualize it, or simply learn it and perform it, to see what the notation means. However, a juggling animator or simulator is able to do so much more swiftly. From the animation you can more easily understand what goes on, decide if you like it or wish to modify it. You can slow it down and pause it, which can help a lot with comprehending the pattern.

There exist also juggling simulators that allow you to edit patterns, so that once you have the simulation you can change the timings, the prop types, or the positions of hands and bodies. Through this editing you can manually create completely new patterns.

# Our own simulator

Inspired by these various motivations, and excited to see the true power of Rhythmic Catches and IMBO in action, Ilse Arwert and myself set out to program a juggling simulator that could handle some of the features of Rhythmic Catches. 

We chose to do this by modifying the open source software [Juggling Lab](https://jugglinglab.org/), for which we had full support and encouragement of its creator Jack Boyce.

## Original goals (see proposal) (DANIEL)
legs, throw and catch with body parts, extending JML

## Why juggling lab instead of JoePass! (Daniel)

## JML is it good? v4 challenges

## Challenges with legacy code, specifically jugglinglab

## What we achieved, Screenshots & link to github repo

# recommendations of how one should build the simulator of the future
